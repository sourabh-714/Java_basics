How to increase/decrese heap size and stack size?

Heap Size: -Xmx200m
-Xms20m -Xmx200m

Stack Size: -Xss2m

-XX-PermSize=20m

String Handling:

- String internally is a char[]
e.g. String name = "Ram";
char name[] = {'R', 'a', 'm'};

- String is a predefine class in java, so it has lot of predefine functions inside the class.
e.g uppercase, lowercase, indexof, split, length
- It is also treat like a Data type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit
- String Objects are created in 2 ways:

1. String Literal Style
e.g. String name = "Ram";

2. String Object Style
e.g. String name = new String("Ram");

- String use String Pool
- String objects are immutable

Immutable - String doesn;t change existing or original objects, it can create new memory or objects all the time.

String Buffer and String Builder- Mutuable - That doesn't create new objects.

- Capacity Cross-16
	(Old Capacity * 2) + 2
	(16 * 2) + 2 = 34 
	
-StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. 
-Two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.

-StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e thread safe.
-Two threads can call the  methods of StringBuilder simultaneously

Assignment - 4

1. Occurrence of a given character in String
2. Occurrence of each character in String
3. Split camel case letter
Regular Camel Case names e.g.
-"camelCaseName" -> [camel, Case, Name]

All lower case names e.g. 
-"lower" -> [lower]

All upper case names e.g.
-"UPPER" -> [UPPER]

Special Cases e.g.
-"specialCASE" -> [special, CASE]
