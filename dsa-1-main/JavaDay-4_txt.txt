C- We think only for functions
- We never think of data, so either data/variable are define local or global.
- And global can be conflict with others

C++ OOPS- Provide a feature of Data Binding using classes
So your class have your variable and your methods that never conflict with others
So we can use for large and complex system
and it fit for real world secenarios

Now in OOPS we can use same variable name, same method name in different classes

What is OOPS?

- Divide a big problem into classes
OOPS Features:

1. Class, Object

- Class- Collection of Features / Characteristics
e.g. Human(Features Brain, Height, 2 Ears)
- Object - ram state brain , 6 feet height
Object - Object contains State(Object Value)

- Class - Category, Blueprint, Layout, Skeleton, Structure
- Object - real time entity
e.g. Fan, Car, Projector
e.g. ram, shyam, geeta

Class - Collection of similar objects


OOAD - Object Oriented Analysis and Design
SOLID - Priciple

D - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Copy Paste Alternative create a function and call it.


Encapsulation
-private member variables and public methods
-Wrap methods and member variables into a single unit  and that unit is called class.

Data Hiding - Good/Secure Encapsulation

-Data Hiding - make member variables private
- Good Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Encapsulation

Scopes:

private - with in the class
default - (not keyword just concept)-scope with in the package
protected - with in the package but i can access also outside the package using Inheritance
public - access on any package.

This Keyword:

- this keyword holds current object address

OOAD-
SOLID
D- DRY - 


Q1. Need to initialize the member variable when object is construct?
Ans: We need constructor for this.
- Constuctor is call when you create an object.
- So constructor will initialize the member variable
- Constructor name is same as class name
- Constructor never return any thing
- It is called only once
- Every class by default have default constructor
- So if you have any other constructor the default one is killed

- One class can have multiple constructors, so for this thing is constructor chaining or constructor overloading

-When we need multiple constructor calls in a single call.
Ans: we need constructor chaining for this.
	this keyword also use for constructor chaining
	
Assignment - 2

Create Employee Class,
Input- id, name, basic salary
Compute - HRA, DA, TA, MA, GS, NS
print - Salary Slip in Indian Format

Constraints:
- company name is fixed for all employees
- basic salary can be alter any time
- id once assign never change
