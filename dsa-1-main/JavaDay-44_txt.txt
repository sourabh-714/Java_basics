1. Check for Balance Binary Tree

2. LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) in a Binary Tree

3. Spiral Order Traversal of a Binary Tree or Level order traversal in spiral form

4. Merge Two Binary Trees

- Given two binary trees, we need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is 
	that if two nodes overlap, them sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
	That means the node is non-null will be used as the node of new tree.

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both the trees.

Algo:
1. Traverse the tree in preorder fashion
2. check if both the tree nodes are null
	- if not, then update the value
3. recursively for left subtree
4. recursively for right subtree
5. return root of updated tree

5. Serialization and Deserialization of a Binary Tree

Serialize:is to store tree in a file that it can be later restored.

Deserialize: is reading tree back from file.

Algo:

A simple solution is to store both inorder and preorder traversals. This solution requires 
space twice the size of binary tree.
We can save space by storing preorder traversal and a marker for NULL pointers.

- marker for NULL pointer = # or -1
