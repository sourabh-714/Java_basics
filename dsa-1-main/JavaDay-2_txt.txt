why main?
- main is a entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it can't execute the code or interpret the code

4 types of scopes in java
public: global, which is accessible for all, fom anywhere
private: accessible within class only
protected: can be accessed inside the package, can also be accessed outside the package by using inheritance
default: it is not a reserved keyword, if you will not specify any scope then it is default. The scope can be accessed by any classs but within same package

Why main is public?
- JRE uses main: java <bytecode>
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your package/directory
- And outside the package things can access

Why main is static?
- Static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded

Why main is void?
- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

main arguments - String args[]
- main has command line arguments
for e.g: copy xyz.txt abc.txt
- copy is a command and xyz, abc are arguments

What is command line arguments?

- we can make our own commands
for e.g. wish happy birthday 9836598466 11:59PM
- wish is a command and happy birthday 9836598466 11:59PM are the arguments
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of string

What is String?

- String is a collection of class
- String internallly is a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println?

- println(): print in new line, println comes from out object
- out: out is a predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System is a predefined class used for input, output, error
e.g. System.out, System.in, System.err

- java doesn't have any garbage value
- it thows error
- Local variables must be initialized before use
- otherwise compilation fails

Data Types

- It is used to store integral only
byte - 1 byte
short - 2 bytes
int - 4 bytes
long - 8 bytes

- Decimal Values
float - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes

- Enter the Age of Student

byte - 1 byte = 8 bits

1 bit +-
7 bits number range
Bit 0, 1 base 2

-2 ^ 7 to 2 ^ 7 - 1
-128 to 127

char - 2 bytes
- because java works on unicode(universal code)
- utf-8 (Universal text format - 8 bits)

- String better than char[]
- String is wrapper class of char[]

BigDecimal and BigInteger:

- BigDecimal: It can handle very large and very small floating point numbers
- BigInteger: It can handle very large and very small integral numbers
