1. Generic Tree

--> Binary Tree:

- It can't have more than 2 children
- It can have 0, 1, or 2 children but not more than 2 children.

Tree Traversals:

1. Inorder Traversal
- Left Subtree Traverse
- Root Node
- Right Subtree Traverse

2. Preorder Traversal
- Root Node
- Left Subtree
- Right Subtree

3. Postorder Traversal
- Left Subtree
- Right Subtree
- Root Node

2. Binary Tree Insertion , Printing (Tree Traversals)

3. Level Order Traversal Of a Binary Tree
- using queue
