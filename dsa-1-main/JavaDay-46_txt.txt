1. Top View of a Binary Tree - Home Work (Again Discussed)

2. Graph Intro

- A graph is a non- linear data structure
- Nodes as vertices and the edges the lines that connect any two nodes/vertices in the graph

Graph Applications:

- Graphs are used to represent networks
	e.g: telephone network or city network, or cicruit network
- Graphs are also used in social media networks, like linkedIn, Facebook etc

cyclic grapgh: A graph is cyclic if the graph has a path that starts from a vertex and ends at the same vertex.

Acyclic Graph: Graph that has no cycle.

Graph Representations:

1. Adjacent List - implementation - done
2. Adjacent Matrix - implementation - done

Graph Traversals:

-Graph Traversal means visiting every vertex and edge exactly once in a well defined order.

1. Breadth First Search or Breadth First Traversal
2. Depth First Search or Depth First Traversal

- BFS implementation - done
- DFS implementation - Home Work

3. Graph Contains path between two vertices or not - Home work
