Abstract:

- Abstract methodfs are methods can only be declared, not defined.
- Abstract class can have abstract methods
- You can't create objects of abstract class

Interface:

- An interafce can have method and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract(only method signature, no body)
- It is used to achieve total abstraction
- Variables in interface are final, public and static
- In interface, we can perform multiple inheritance

Not supported multiple inheritance in java by using classes
class parent1{}

class parent2{}

class child extends parent1, parent2{}

Memory Management(GC Eligibility)

case 1: Enemy obj - new Enemy();
		obj = null; // this object is eleigible for GC
		
case 2:
Object out of scope
if(10 > 2) {
	Enemy obj - new Enemy();
}

case 3:
Enemy obj - new Enemy();
Enemy obj2 - new Enemy();
obj2 = obj;// obj-99, obj2-88 , obj2 = 99

now, obj2 is eligibe for GC.

GC:
1. Minor GC- young generation
2. Maos/Major GC - old generation
