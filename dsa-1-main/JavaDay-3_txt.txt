Wrapper Classes

- wrapper class is a class
- whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
- we can wrap a primitive data types / value into a wrapper class object

primitive data types- int, float, double, etc

Wrapper Classes- Integer, Character, Float, Double, Byte

Autoboxing - int to Integer, float to Float
Unboxing - Integer to int, Float to float

BufferedReader
- BufferedReader is a class that reads text from a character-input stream
- it provides efficient reading of sequence of characters

2 major types of programming:

- Procedural - Functions - Divide a problem into functions
- OOPS - Wrap all the variables and functions into a single unit - class

Why OOPS?
class A
{
int x, y;

add() {
}
sub() {
}
mul() {
}
div() {
}
}
class B{
sin() {
	double x;
}
}

Is java has global variable?
- No, because in java every program start with class, and class doesn't have global variable
