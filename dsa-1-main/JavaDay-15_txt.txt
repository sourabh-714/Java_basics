Array:

-Array are oldest and simplest data structure
-Homogeneous (same kind) values contains, continuous memory location, Access using index

Good parts of Array:

- It provide random access

RA = Base Address + index * size

- Cache Friendly: Cache Always bring the near by data(like Contigous data)
	because elements are continuous so next index element always on the cache, so fast access.
	
-Good for searching because elements are on continuous memory location

One - d Array Declaration Styles
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int []arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int arr[] = new int[]{10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int arr[] = new int[10];

Insert an element in Array
arr[index] = element - O(1) TC

Read the element from the particular index
element = arr[index] - O(1) TC

Q 1. Reverse an Array - Home Work

Q 2. Sort 0, 1 Array
{1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0}

-First count all the zero's
-Then start from 0th index and go till count and fill all the zero's there
-And rest after count to array length - 1 fill the 1's
