Why you learn data structure?

1. Finding Shortest Path - Google map do
2. Stacks: Undo Operations, Browsers Back Functionality
3. Graphs: are used to represents relationships such as social networking sites.
Using GPS/Google Maps/Yahoo Maps to find a route based on shortest route
4. Tree:
	1. Folders in Operating System
	2. Any mark up language uses Tree structure called as DOM
	3. Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.
Queue:
1. Queue is also used by Operating System for job scheduling
2. Queue is used in key pressing sequence in keyboard
3. Queue is used in networking to handle congestion

Doubly Linked List: a music playlist and browser navigation (back and forward)

What is Algorithm?

Sequential steps for solving a problem
e.g. How to make a tea

Measures of Performance:

1. Time: 
- Amount of Processing or Number of operations

2. Space or Extra Space:
- This is both memory needed by code to store information at runtime as well as disk space needed by code for persistence/permanent storage

3. Network:
The bandwidth code uses to pass information to clients or other machines


#How we calculate the execution of the code

- Time taken is proportional to number of operations and input size

Asymptotic Notation:

It is a mathematical way to represent, the complexity of a algo.

big omega: Best Case - Input favour the algo
e.g. If inputs are sorted in nature of searching algo

Big O (Upper bound of a function) Worst Case- Input not favour the Algo

Theta Notation: Average Case- Random Inputs

e.g. If inputs are 10 and want ot search in array.
Best Case 1 comparison, Found on First Match
Worst Case 10 comparison, Found on Last Match

Rate of Growth are generalized in the following form:

1 Constant
log N - Logarithmic
N - Linear
NlogN - Linear Log
N^2 - Quadratic
N^3 - Cubic
2^N - Exponential
