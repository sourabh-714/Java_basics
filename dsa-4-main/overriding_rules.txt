final
super vs this
overriding method vs variable
Multi-level hierarchy

final
- when we want to freeze a value
- 3 ways to use final : class, method, variable

super vs this
- child constructor automatically call parent's constructor
- implicit call
- in case we want to call parameterised constructor of parent class than we need to write super explicitly
- if we comment parent's default constructor than it will give compile error
- so we have to use super in child's default constructor


Overriding rules
1. Weaker Access Rule
Scope - private, default(not reserved keyword), protected, public

Packages - group of classes - modularity - similar classes will be together

package name 
- com - commercial
- org - organization

private < default < protected < public

- we can't make override method to lower scope, means weaker access
- If parent't method is protected, than child method cannot be default or private...


2. CoVariant return type rule
  - we can return more features in overrided function
