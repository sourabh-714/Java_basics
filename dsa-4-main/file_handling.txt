Streams - Flow of data

Text - Reader, Writer (abstract)

IS-A Serialization
- if we serialize parent, then child will be serialized automatically

Another case
- Only child is serializable
 - it will serialize parent + child
 - but while doing deserialization, only parent const will be called
 - because deserialization only happens when class is serializable...
